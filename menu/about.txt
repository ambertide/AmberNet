About

This is the minimal version of amberti.de website written
in AtomTerm, an AGPL-v3 project that can be found under
https://github.com/ambertide/AtomTerm.

You can use arrow keys to navigate, and left arrow to exit.

The source code of this website in particular can be found
in https://github.com/ambertide/AmberNet. It is served
over GCP using Github Actions and systemd.

If you somehow manage to crash the server because I missed
something, wait for thirty seconds and it should return.

Also this runs on a spot VM because I am a cheapstake, so
it might literally go away.
